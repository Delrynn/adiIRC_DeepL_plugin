# AdiIRC Deepl Plugin

This plugin allows to mark nicknames for automatic translation to english using the DeepL API.
A DeepL API Key is required and can be set using the /dl-api command.
/dl-help will list all supported commands.
The most important one would be /deepl-mon <nick> to mark that nickname for translation.

In addition to the general translation feature there is some Fuelrats(fuelrats.com) integration as well.
Incoming cases and their language can be identified and marked for tranlation if needed.
